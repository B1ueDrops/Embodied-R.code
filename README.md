This project provides the official code for Embodied-R, a collaborative framework designed to enhance embodied spatial reasoning tasks. Embodied-R leverages the perceptual capabilities of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieves significant performance improvements by training only a small-scale Language Model (LM). By combining the strengths of these models, Embodied-R offers an efficient yet powerful solution for complex spatial reasoning tasks in embodied AI.

## News

[2025/04/19] We release the basic training and inference code of Embodied-R.
[2025/04/26] We add support for 5-GPU training and local API service, eliminating the need for commercial API calls during training.

## Installation

The Embodied-R project is built on the ModelScope ms-swift open-source framework. Please follow these steps to install:

1. Ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

   - Python = 3.10
   - Transformers = 4.51
   - DeepSpeed = 0.14.5
   - VLLM = 0.7.3
2. Install the ms-swift framework:

   ```bash
   pip install ms-swift -U
   ```
3. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/Embodied-R.code.git
   cd Embodied-R.code
   ```

## Setup

### Data Preparation

First, download the [UrbanVideo-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmbodiedCity/UrbanVideo-Bench) and [VSI-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/VSI-Bench) datasets.

After downloading, organize the directories as shown below (some parts are omitted with "..."):

```
Embodied-R.code/
├── assets/
├── dataset/
│   ├── UrbanVideo-Bench/
│   │   ├── videos/
│   │   ├── MCQ.parquet
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── VSI-Bench/
│   │   ├── arkitscenes.zip
│   │   ├── scannet.zip
│   │   ├── scannetpp.zip
│   │   ├── test-00000-of-00001.parquet
│   │   └── ...
└── ...
```

Then, run the following command and the processed datasets will be stored in `dataset/complete`:

```bash
python dataset/data_preprocess.py
```

### Model Weight Download

Embodied-R uses two main models: a vision module and a reasoning module.

1. **Vision Module Model**:

   - Download [Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct)
   - This large vision-language model is responsible for processing video frames and extracting key semantic information
2. **Reasoning Module Model**:

   - Download [Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct)
   - This small language model is trained with reinforcement learning, specifically for spatial reasoning tasks

> **Note**:Although the input here is textual, we recommend using the LM Decoder of the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct as the small-scale foundation model. This is because the pretraining of VL models involves multimodal/video-related content, which can benefit the LM Decoder. Fine-tuning on this basis will enable faster convergence.

After downloading, place the model weights in an appropriate directory, or specify the model path when running scripts.

## Inference Examples

Embodied-R provides two inference methods: batch inference and interactive inference.

### Batch Inference

**Important: Complete Video Processing Pipeline**

Before running batch inference, you need to first process videos using `train/conver_format/VLM_perception_local.py` or `train/conver_format/VLM_perception_API.py` to generate text descriptions of the videos. This step converts video content into text representations for the reasoning model to use. The complete pipeline is as follows:

 **Option 1: Using local large model**

   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/VLM_perception_local.py --data_paths [JSON_FILES] --folder_path [VIDEOS_FOLDER] --model_path [VISION_MODEL_PATH] --save_path [RESULTS_PATH]
   ```

   Parameters:
   - `--data_paths`: JSON files containing data, can specify multiple files, default: `['dataset/complete/test_data.json', 'dataset/complete/train_data.json', 'dataset/complete/val_data.json']`
   - `--folder_path`: Folder containing video files, default: `dataset/complete/videos`
   - `--model_path`: Path to the vision model, default: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Vl-72B-instruct`
   - `--save_path`: Path to save results, default: `results/inter`

   Example (using custom data):
   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/VLM_perception_local.py --data_paths my_data.json --folder_path my_videos_path --model_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-Vl-72B-instruct --save_path my_results_path
   ```

   **Option 2: Using commercial API**

   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/VLM_perception_API.py --data_paths [JSON_FILES] --folder_path [VIDEOS_FOLDER] --api_key [API_KEY] --base_url [API_BASE_URL] --save_path [RESULTS_PATH]
   ```

   Parameters:
   - `--data_paths`: JSON files containing data, can specify multiple files, default: `['dataset/complete/test_data.json', 'dataset/complete/train_data.json', 'dataset/complete/val_data.json']`
   - `--folder_path`: Folder containing video files, default: `dataset/complete/videos`
   - `--api_key`: OpenAI API key, default: None (if not provided, will try to get from environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
   - `--base_url`: API base URL, default: `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`
   - `--save_path`: Path to save results, default: `results/inter`

   Example (using custom data):
   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/VLM_perception_API.py --data_paths my_data.json --folder_path my_videos_path --api_key your_api_key --save_path my_results_path
   ```

   > **Note**: Qwen officially provides API services for their open-source models, which are identical to the locally deployed small-scale foundation models. If local computing resources are limited, API can be used for training-free reference models.

2. Run batch inference using the generated text descriptions:

   ```bash
   cd infer
   bash run_batch_inference.sh \
     --model "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct" \
     --input_file "results/inter/test_data.json" \
     --output_file "results/infer/inference_result.json" \
     --batch_size 1 \
     --max_tokens 3096
   ```

Input JSON file format example:

```json
[
  {
    "Question_id": "video_infer",
    "video_id": "example.mp4",
    "question_category": "object_rel_direction",
    "question": "<video>Please assume the role of an agent...",
    "answer": "A",
    "videos": "path/to/video.mp4"
  },
  {
    "Question_id": "text_infer",
    "question": "Please assume the role of an agent...",
    "answer": "B"
  }
]
```

**Important Notes**:

- **Video Inference**: You must add the `<video>` prefix to the `question` field and include both `videos` and `question` fields. Other fields (such as `Question_id`, `video_id`, etc.) are optional.
- **Text Inference**: Only the `question` field is required.
- The inference results will preserve all input fields (pass-through) and add a `content` field containing the model's response.

### Interactive Inference

Interactive inference provides a command-line interface that allows users to upload videos and ask questions. Start interactive inference using the following command:

```bash
cd infer
bash run_video_chat.sh
```

You can customize the vision model and reasoning model by modifying the `run_video_chat.sh` script:

```bash
# Set model paths
VISION_MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct"  # Vision model path
REASONING_MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct"   # Reasoning model path

# Set parameters
MAX_TOKENS=4096                # Max output tokens for reasoning module
TEMPERATURE=0.7                # Temperature for reasoning module
VISION_MAX_TOKENS=6144         # Max output tokens for vision module
VISION_TEMPERATURE=0.1         # Temperature for vision module
```

## RL Training

Embodied-R uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train the reasoning module for high-quality spatial reasoning. The training code is located in the `train` folder.

### Training Environment Requirements

Recommended configurations:

- Standard version: 8x NVIDIA A800 GPUs with 40GB memory each
- Lightweight version: 5x NVIDIA A800 GPUs with 40GB memory each (new)
  - GPUs 0-3: For GRPO training (4-card parallel)
  - GPU 4: For local consistency verification model service

### Training Pipeline

**Important: Complete Training Data Preparation Process**

Before training the model, you need to complete the following data preparation steps:

1. Generate video descriptions using the vision model:

   **Option 1: Using local large model**

   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/VLM_perception_local.py
   ```

   **Option 2: Using commercial API**

   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/VLM_perception_API.py
   ```
2. Convert the generated text descriptions to GRPO training format:

   ```bash
   python train/conver_format/convert_GrpoFormat.py
   ```
3. Start training:

   **New 5-GPU version** (uses local API service for consistency reward):

   ```bash
   bash train/train_5GPUs.sh
   ```

   **Standard 8-GPU version** (uses commercial API for consistency reward):

   ```bash
   bash train/train_8GPUs.sh
   ```

The training script uses the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) algorithm, a PPO variant designed specifically for large language models. You can customize the training process by modifying parameters in the training scripts:

```bash
# Key parameters in both scripts
--model "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct"  # Base model
--reward_weights 0.7 0.1 0.2         # Reward weights (accuracy, format, consistency)
--reward_funcs choice_accuracy format consistency  # Reward functions
--learning_rate 5e-7                 # Learning rate
--num_train_epochs 2                 # Number of training epochs
```

**Key differences between the two versions:**

1. **5-GPU version** (`train_5GPUs.sh`):

   - Uses 4 GPUs (0-3) for training
   - Uses 1 GPU (4) for local consistency verification service
   - Automatically starts the local consistency service
   - Uses local API for consistency reward (`consistency_reward_local.py`)
   - No need for commercial API keys

2. **8-GPU version** (`train_8GPUs.sh`):

   - Uses all 8 GPUs for training
   - Uses commercial API for consistency reward (`consistency_reward_API.py`)
   - Higher throughput with more GPUs

For more details about the local consistency service, please refer to `train/reward/README_local_consistency.md`.

### Reward Modeling

Embodied-R uses two main rewards to guide model learning:

1. **Choice Accuracy Reward**:

   - Evaluates whether the model's answer matches the correct answer
   - Implemented in `train/reward/choice_accuracy_reward.py`
2. **Format Reward**:
   - Ensures the model output follows the format `<think>reasoning process</think><answer>answer</answer>`
3. **Consistency Reward**:

   - Evaluates whether the model's reasoning process is logically consistent with its final answer
   - Works by inputting the reasoning process into a reference model to check if it produces the same answer
   - **Two options for reference model access**:

     a) **Local API Service**:

     - Implemented in `train/reward/consistency_reward_local.py`
     - Used in the 5-GPU version (`train_5GPUs.sh`)
     - Runs a local model service on GPU 4

     ```bash
     # Start the local API service
     bash train/reward/start_consistency_service.sh
     ```

     b) **Commercial API (Bailian platform)**:

     - Implemented in `train/reward/consistency_reward_API.py`
     - Used in the 8-GPU version (`train_8GPUs.sh`)

     ```python
     # Enter your API keys here
     default_api_keys = [
         # API keys obtained from the Bailian platform
     ]
     ```

     Please visit the [Bailian platform](https://www.aliyun.com/product/bailian) to apply for API keys
     
Training adopts a three-stage strategy with gradually adjusted reward weights:

1. Stage 1 (first 2 epochs): Focus on format reward, weight ratio 7:3:0
2. Stage 2 (epochs 3-4): Focus on accuracy reward, weight ratio 3:7:0
3. Stage 3 (epochs 5-12): Focus on both accuracy and consistency, weight ratio 1:7:2
